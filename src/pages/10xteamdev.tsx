      <Paragraph>
        It is not enough for a team to have skilled individuals. In order for
        technical teams to excel, there are many factors that need to align. The
        day-to-day friction needs to be as close to zero as possible.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Architectures, libraries choices, PR reviews, branching strategy, CI
        pipelines, deployments, release management, automated tests, hotfixes,
        feature flags, rollbacks, ticket management, design handovers, business
        goals changes, documentation.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        All these topics are part of what we call ‚Äúmeta-development‚Äù and they
        are usually decided as after-thoughts because they don&apos;t directly
        provide value to the end users. However, they are the elements that
        introduce friction on a daily basis, making your team slower and
        ultimately losing their motivation to ship.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Young teams usually start experiencing the effect of these decisions
        after shipping the MVP or when they start hiring more engineers to
        accelerate growth. What was once sacrificed for the sake of speed now
        creates all kinds of symptoms. Slow onboarding times, regressions, user
        complaints, decreased performance, lower energy levels, lack of
        visibility about production issues, single points of failure in the
        team, architectures not being respected, and many more.
