						<p class="title">Chapter 5: Miscellaneous</p>
						<p class="content">Dear diary, <br><br>Today I published Chapter 5 of my series "How I fell in love with React". It has however no main focus, I decided
						to talk about 3 different things/problems I came across in the last 10 days of my first month using React. In particular, ES6, fonts and a new open source
						React component.

						<p class="title">LearnGraphQL</p>
						<p class="content">Dear diary, <br><br>I discovered a couple of days ago <a href="https://learngraphql.com/" target="_blank">LearnGraphQL</a> course by 
						<a href="https://twitter.com/arunoda" target="_blank">@arunoda</a>, and sinceresly, it's awesome. <br>I had any experience with 
						<a href="http://graphql.org/" target="_blank">GraphQL</a> and after following it I managed to build my small API on a 
						<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> database.<br>
						The only downfall about it is that it later uses <a href="https://github.com/gordonmleigh/promised-mongo" target="_blank">promised-mongo</a> to interact
						with MongoDB API and the steps they provide don't work (at least in my case). So I had to search somewhere else and I ended up using 
						<a href="http://mongoosejs.com/" target="_blank">Mongoose</a>. <br>Except from that everything is very well explained and this small problem is just related
						with how you fetch data in your program, not GraphQL itself.
						<br><br>Week is ending and I'm hungry to learn more!</p>

						<p class="content">Dear diary, <br><br>Today I published Chapter 4 of my series "How I fell in love with React". It is about the
						first my first real React component which was also the first time I was sharing something through npm. You can find inside it 
						all the steps I followed plus some recommendations about sharing React Components.<br>

						<p class="title">Server vs Client Rendering</p>
						<p class="content">Today I have finally understood the pros and cons of server and client rendering thanks to
						<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-tradeoffs-of-client-side-rendering-vs-server-side-rendering" target="_blank">
							this article.
						</a>
						<br>It's a little bit updated but the first paragraphs are still true and very useful. I am going to try some server rendering for 
						this website very soon, I will let you know they results and how I did it ! ;) 
						<br><br> Have a nice day.</p>

						<p class="content">Hi ! How is your day going ? <br> I just published Chapter 3 of my "How I fell in love with React" series. It is about the

					<p class="title">New Website</p>
					<p class="content">Welcome ! <br>After a long time being in doubt about starting my small blog, I finally decided to create a very simple personal website to replace the ugly
					landing page I had before. Yet this is a very simple website and the blog entries will be too. Expect them to be like a diary (except for the everyday part) where I share things
					about what I did that day. Tutorials, articles, videos or anything I discovered that day ! <br><br>I hope you will enjoy the format. <br> Have a nice day.</p>
