						<p class="title">Server vs Client Rendering</p>
						<p class="content">Today I have finally understood the pros and cons of server and client rendering thanks to
						<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-tradeoffs-of-client-side-rendering-vs-server-side-rendering" target="_blank">
							this article.
						</a>
						<br>It's a little bit updated but the first paragraphs are still true and very useful. I am going to try some server rendering for 
						this website very soon, I will let you know they results and how I did it ! ;) 
						<br><br> Have a nice day.</p>

						<p class="title">Chapter 3: First Projects</p>
						<p class="content">Hi ! How is your day going ? <br> I just published Chapter 3 of my "How I fell in love with React" series. It is about the
						first projects and tutorials I followed when I started learning React and how I managed to build everything with Webpack to publish it on a
						website.

					<p class="title">New Website</p>
					<p class="content">Welcome ! <br>After a long time being in doubt about starting my small blog, I finally decided to create a very simple personal website to replace the ugly
					landing page I had before. Yet this is a very simple website and the blog entries will be too. Expect them to be like a diary (except for the everyday part) where I share things
					about what I did that day. Tutorials, articles, videos or anything I discovered that day ! <br><br>I hope you will enjoy the format. <br> Have a nice day.</p>
